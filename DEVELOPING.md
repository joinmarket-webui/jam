# Developer Docs

A place to collect useful information for developers that doesn't really fit elsewhere.

ðŸ‘‰ See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get started participating in this project.

## JoinMarket Development Environment

For a complete development environment you need a local JoinMarket instance that the web UI can interact with. We provide a regtest environment that should give you everything needed to get started developing with JoinMarket. You can find details here: [docker/regtest/readme.md](docker/regtest/readme.md).

## Linting

We use Create React App's [default ESLint integration](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/setting-up-your-editor/#displaying-lint-output-in-the-editor).
You'll see linting issues in the console when running the app with `npm start`.
Pull request builds will fail if ESLint is not happy with the code.

## Code Formatting

We use the [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) code formatter to keep a consistent code style.
Pull request builds will fail if Prettier is not happy with the code.
There's a couple of options on how to setup Prettier so that it formats your code automatically:

### NPM Script

Running `npm run format` will format the whole codebase.

### Editor Integration

Prettier has great [editor integrations](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) which will automatically format all files you touch.

### Git Pre-Commit Hook

You can use a pre-commit hook that will automatically format all changes before comitting them to Git.
We use [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) for that.

By default, the hook will be installed automatically as an [NPM postinstall script](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/scripts#npm-install).

### Troubleshooting

If you're having issues with Husky not using the correct `$PATH`, you may need to setup a `~/.huskyrc` which will let you set up your path before the hook is run.
See [here](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=command-not-found) for more info.

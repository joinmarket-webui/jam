# Contributing to This Project

This is a [free](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#Expat) and [open-source](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) software project and we love receiving pull-requests, bug reports, ideas, and feedback from everyone.
The aim of this document is to help you get setup for participating in all areas of this project quicklyâ€”whether that's submitting code via a pull request, testing the latest iteration, reporting issues, writing documentation, etc.

## Understanding the Components Involved

Jam is a web UI for [JoinMarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/) with focus on user-friendliness.
The web UI's purpose is to be a rather lightweight front end for the JoinMarket API.
To function, the web UI needs to connect to an instance of JoinMarket with [the API service](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/blob/master/docs/JSON-RPC-API-using-jmwalletd.md) running.

You don't need to worry about that, though.
To ease development and testing, we provide a Docker setup that runs JoinMarket and its API service in a regtest setup.
It isn't needed to dig deeper into how it works to use it.
However, if you want to find out more about it, see [docker/regtest/readme.md](docker/regtest/readme.md).

## Submitting a Pull Request

[Fork](https://github.com/joinmarket-webui/joinmarket-webui/fork), then clone this repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/joinmarket-webui.git
```

Start the JoinMarket HTTP API service in regtest:

```sh
docker-compose --file docker/regtest/docker-compose.yml up
```

Initialize the regtest setup. This creates and funds a wallet `funded` with password `test`.

```sh
docker/regtest/init-setup.sh
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Start the UI on port 3000:

```sh
npm start
```

Make your changes and be sure to manually test them before submitting them to us.

Once you're sure the changes work well, push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/joinmarket-webui/joinmarket-webui/compare/).
We will try to at least comment on your pull request within a couple of days. We may suggest some changes, improvements, or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

- Make sure the changes work well and cover edge cases.
- Make sure your code is formatted. This should happen automatically using a Git commit-hook. If not, see [docs/developing.md](docs/developing.md) for more details.
- Write a meaningful pull request description message.

If your pull request is accepted, a maintainer will squash it into master.
We follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention when squashing pull requests to master.
You can follow this convention for commits on your fork but this isn't a requirement for your pull request to be accepted.

## Testing the Latest Iteration

Clone this repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:joinmarket-webui/joinmarket-webui.git
```

Checkout the version you want to test. If you want to test the cutting edge development version, simply skip this step and test directly on master.

```sh
git fetch --tags git checkout <version>
```

Start the JoinMarket HTTP API service in regtest:

```sh
docker-compose --file docker/regtest/docker-compose.yml up
```

Initialize the regtest setup. This creates and funds a wallet `funded` with password `test`.

```sh
docker/regtest/init-setup.sh
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Start the UI on port 3000:

```sh
npm start
```

Enjoy the test drive!

## Reporting Issues

Reporting an issue is as easy as [opening one on GitHub](https://github.com/joinmarket-webui/joinmarket-webui/issues/new).
Be sure to provide a detailed description of what you think is wrong and add as much context as possible.
If applicable, include step-by-step instruction on how to reproduce the issue.
Before you submit an issue, please have a quick look at the [currently open issues](https://github.com/joinmarket-webui/joinmarket-webui/issues).
You might find that another person has already reported the same thing.
